# Please Rewind | Merry Movies

Each year, we always say we want to send out a Christmas card, but
we never get around to doing it. So this year we decided to try
and do something a little different. We hope you all enjoy at
least one of the movies. We wish you and yours a happy and healthy
holiday season.

We hope you enjoy our spin on the traditional Christmas advent
calendar. Each day, another of our favorite holiday movies are
revealed. Watch a new holiday movie everyday! (Or when time allows, because really, who has time to watch a
movie every day?)

We used [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev/) to help with the layouts/components.
Also, as usual, a shoutout to [Ryan Mulligan](https://ryanmulligan.dev) for being our CSS sherpa. His blog post on [horizontal scrolling](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/x-scrolling-centered-max-width-container/) really helped with the mobile version of the site.

This project was built with Astro 3.0. I wanted to mess around with the view transitions API, and it turns out its pretty easy to work with. There are still some little glitches I see, but I'm pretty excited to see what else can be built with them. I also wanted to try and build this using minimal javascript and just focus on HTML and CSS. It's really just the date and some conditional rendering.
